# Manifests
These are OpenShift/Kubernetes manifests to be used with Rahti. See rahti-guide.md in docs for a comprehensive starting guide for the initialization of the app in Rahti. The news-collection-complete.yaml is the general manifest users should copy and use. The guest.yaml is used when inviting other people to try the app through your Rahti project in their own separate environment. manifests_components has component-specific manifests.
