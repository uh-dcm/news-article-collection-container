            <p>
              On the Search page, you can perform searches on the contents of
              the articles and also download queried articles as JSON, CSV or
              Parquet. Search inputs are possible in the four data types
              collected: full text, URL, time and HTML.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Time is split into start time and end time, with the formatting
              being YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, and the input of partial values also
              being possible.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              You can use the AND, OR and NOT boolean operators to refine your
              search, although spaces between words are automatically treated as
              AND. Queries for specific phrases happen by encasing them in
              quotation marks.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              You can do wildcard searches with _ (matches any character) and %
              (matches any sequence of 0+ characters). You can escape % and _
              with ESC: ESC%.
