              On the Search page, you can perform searches on the contents of
              the articles and also download queried articles as JSON, CSV or
              Parquet. The basic search looks at three data types: full text,
              URL and time.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Advanced search overrides general search. In the advanced search,
              the inputs are split for each data type. Time is split into start
              and end time, and inputs for these need to be in the format
              YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, also allowing the input of partial values
              like YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD HH. Additionally, you can perform
              searches on the more code-like HTML data.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              You can use the AND, OR and NOT boolean operators to refine your
              search, although spaces between words are automatically treated as
              AND. Queries for specific phrases happen by encasing them in
              quotation marks.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              You can do wildcard searches with _ (matches any character) and %
              (matches any sequence of 0+ characters). You can escape % and _
              with ESC: ESC%.
