# This is a thorough tests run script that also installs the dependencies
# Place at project root and run in terminal with "bash runtests.sh" or "./runtests.sh"
# If "Permission denied", run "chmod +x runtests.sh" once
# On Windows the script should work with WSL

# Things that may help in rare non-code related issues:
# 1. npm dependency discrepancy issue: 
# delete node_modules folder, let it get reinstalled by this script fresh
# 2. docker build not starting:
# restart your system's Docker (Docker Desktop etc.)
# run "docker system prune" to free up resources
# 3. terminal window affected by something: 
# close the terminal window and open a fresh one
